# MazeSearch
a program to read a given maze (provided in a text form) and find the shortest path from start to finish. Mazes go back to antiquity and the story of the minotaur. You will implement breadth-first search, a simple algorithm that finds not just any path to the exit in a maze, but actually finds a shortest path from the start to the finish.
